  <h1>What Are Web-Based Applications?</h1>

<div id="preamble">
  <p>
    Everyone knows what software is.  Word processors. Web browsers. Windows. Sim City.  Software can also be described as an application, which runs on a computer.  Your word processor lets you create a file, store it on your hard drive, load it up and change it.  Your word processing application runs locally, on the machine you are sitting at, manipulating data that exists in the hard drives in the box you are sitting in front of. But what if your word processing application existed on someone else's computer?  What if the file you create was stored on yet another computer? What if the applications you used existed somewhere else, and all you needed was a connection to the internet in order to use them?  What about opening up a browser and typing in a <abbr>URL</abbr> to a word processor, and being able to use that application in any browser, on any computer, anywhere in the world?  That is the benefit of web applications.  Limebits helps you create web applications.
