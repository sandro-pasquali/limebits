    From Wikipedia:
  </p>
  <p>
    Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning, or <abbr>WebDAV</abbr>, is a set of extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<abbr>HTTP</abbr>) that allows users to edit and manage files collaboratively on remote World Wide Web servers. The protocol is defined in <abbr title="Request For Comments">RFC</abbr> 4918. The group of developers responsible for these extensions was also known by the same name and was a working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (<abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The <abbr>WebDAV</abbr> protocol allows "Intercreativity," making the Web a readable and writable medium, in line with Tim Berners-Lee's original vision. It allows users to create, change and move documents on a remote server (typically a web server or "web share"). This is useful for authoring the documents that a web server serves, but it can also be used for storing files on the web, so that the files can be accessed from anywhere. The most important features of the WebDAV protocol are: locking ("overwrite prevention"); properties (creation, removal, and querying of information about author, modified date, etc.); name space management (ability to copy and move Web pages within a server's namespace); and collections (creation, removal, and listing of resources). Many modern operating systems provide built-in support for <abbr>WebDAV</abbr>. With a fast network and the right client, it is almost as easy to use files on a <abbr>WebDAV</abbr> server as those stored in local directories.
